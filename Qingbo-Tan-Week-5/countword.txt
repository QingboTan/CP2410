This is a sample text file. It contains some words, including words with internal punctuation, like "don't" or "can't". We want to count the frequency of each word in this file. The words should be considered regardless of their case. So, 'The' and 'the' should be counted as the same word. Punctuation at the beginning or end of words, such as 'word,' and 'word' should also be treated as the same. Let's see how the function handles this!
